After the first translation she became one of our most valuable freelance employees, the person we turned to with questions and special projects regarding specific translations for the Amazon UK market. In her time with us, she has demonstrated the personal, organisational and interpersonal skills that make her a truly exceptional translator. Her professional and communication skills made our working relationship very pleasant.`

Her work is impeccable, if you have doubts she clarifies them and if you have changes she makes them for you. It was also very pleasant to work with her, as in a short time she answered the questions we had. We will definitely work with her again!`

Not only is it an accurate translation, but she even completed every chapter ahead of her deadlines and always communicated very well. Well done Hannah! We look forward to working with you again.`
