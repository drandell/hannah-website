2. ##### Proofreading

The general rule of thumb is to always translate into your mother tongue. But sometimes, you may often see text in English that has clearly been translated by a non-native English speaker, which is where errors can occur. Or, you may have even written a piece of text yourself in English but are worried about it not sounding natural. If you’re a company, and are serious about expanding to the UK market, it is really important that your content is accurate for your target audience.
   
With a combination of a high attention to detail and being a native speaker of the English language, I can proofread your work for you, check for errors and ensure that the content and style of the text is completely accurate. 

3. ##### MT Post-Editing

Machine translation has drastically improved over the years thanks to AI machine learning techniques. However, despite it translating text almost instantly, it still makes mistakes and can produce highly inaccurate content. If you have used MT and want to make sure it is 100% accurate, I can read through your MT content and check for any errors or inaccuracies. 
  
MT is great if you’re simply looking up something on a website and want to use it to get an idea of what the text means. However, if you want a translation that needs a lot of creativity as well as true accuracy, only a human translator can provide this for you. 

4. ##### US into UK English

Despite being the same language, there are many differences between UK and US English. This goes further than just spelling (for example: colour, color). Text that has been written for the US market will not necessarily work for the UK market, and vice versa. It is important that if you have American English text and are looking to bring this to a UK audience, adjustments will need to be made before publishing it. I will be able to adapt your US English text and tailor it to the UK market.
