My name is Hannah and I am a multilingual freelance translator from Wales, UK. In 2016, I graduated with a First-Class Honours (BA) in French and German Language from Cardiff University. 

With nearly one and a half yearsâ€™ professional experience, I have the ability to proficiently translate text from German and French into English. 

After graduating, I completed a 3-month translation internship in Zurich, Switzerland in order to develop my skills as a translator. Since returning to the UK, I have worked in Marketing, and for the last 1.5 years, I have been working as a freelance translator, specialising in translation for a variety of different industries. I am also an Associate member of the Institute of Translation and Interpreting, which promotes high standards in translation. 

Since studying German and French in secondary school, I have always had a true passion for languages and it has been clear to me that I have always wanted a career in translation. I have been lucky to find regular clients who not only trust me and my work, but praise the work I provide for them. There really is no better feeling!  

I have experience in translating texts for various industries for a wide range of clients. This includes: dental translation, SEO marketing translation, and website translation. You can find out more about the exact services I provide below.
