My name is Hannah and I am a multilingual freelance translator from Wales, United Kingdom. In 2016, I graduated with a First-Class Honours (BA) in French and German from Cardiff University. I have three years of professional experience, translating from French and German into English, and specialising in marketing, medical (dental), and website translation.
  
My passion for languages stems from studying French and German in secondary school, and I have endeavoured to pursue a career in translation ever since. After graduating from university, I completed a translation internship in Switzerland in order to develop my skills as a translator, before returning to the UK.
  
I am an associate member of the Institute of Translation and Interpreting and a member of the Chartered Institute of Linguists, both of which promote high standards and proficiency in translation. I have been lucky to find regular clients who not only trust me and my skills, but praise the work I provide for them. There really is no better feeling!
