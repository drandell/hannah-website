My name is Hannah and I am a multilingual freelance translator from Wales, United Kingdom. In 2016, I graduated with a First-Class Honours (BA) in French and German Language from Cardiff University.  I have nearly two years of professional experience, and have the ability to proficiently translate text from German and French into English. 
  
My passion for languages stems from studying German and French in high school, and I have endeavoured to pursue a career in translation ever since. After graduating, I completed a translation internship in Zurich, Switzerland, in order to develop my skills as a translator. 
  
Since returning to the UK, I have worked in Marketing, and I have been working as a freelance translator, specialising in translating texts for a wide range of clients from a variety of industries. I have experience in dental/medical translation, SEO marketing translation, website translation and more. You can find out more about the exact services I provide below.
  
I am an associate member of the Institute of Translation and Interpreting, which promotes high standards in translation. I have been lucky to find regular clients who not only trust me, and my work, but praise the work I provide for them. There really is no better feeling!
